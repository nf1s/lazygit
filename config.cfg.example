# Jira tickets are usually prefixed with the project name, e.g. "ABC-1234".
# In this case, the JIRA_TICKET_PREFIX should be set to is "ABC".
# We can add multiple prefixes by separating them with a comma, e.g. "ABC,DEF"
# JIRA_TICKET_PREFIX is case insensitive.
# JIRA_COMPANY is your Jira workspace usually like `your_company.atlassian.net`
# In this case, JIRA_COMPANY=your_company
